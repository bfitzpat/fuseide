Project Templates
==================
This directory contains template projects to be used with the new Fuse Integration Project wizard.

The following templates are functionally complete:

* blank/blank-blueprint (creates an empty Blueprint project)
* blank/blank-java (creates an empty Java project)
* blank/blank-spring (creates an empty Spring project)
* simple/amq/simple-fuse-activemq-java (creates a Java DSL-based project that uses ActiveMQ queues and a working Java unit test)
* simple/amq/simple-fuse-activemq-spring (creates a Spring-based project that uses ActiveMQ queues and a working Spring unit test)
* simple/cbr/simple-fuse-cbr-blueprint (creates a Blueprint-based project that shows content based routing in action and includes a working test)
* simple/cbr/simple-fuse-cbr-java (creates a Java DSL-based project that shows content based routing in action and includes a working test)
* simple/cbr/simple-fuse-cbr-spring (creates a Spring-based project that shows content based routing in action and includes a working test)

The following templates are not functionally complete:

* simple/amq/simple-fuse-activemq-blueprint (creates a Spring-based project that uses ActiveMQ queues and a working Blueprint unit test) (Blueprint test fails)
* medium/cxf-contract-first/medium-fuse-cxf-contract-first-blueprint (creates a Blueprint-based project that demonstrates a WSDL-based SOAP service) (OrderTest works when project is deployed on a running server but BlueprintXmlTest fails)
* medium/cxf-contract-first/medium-fuse-cxf-contract-first-spring (creates a Spring-based project that demonstrates a WSDL-based SOAP service) (OrderTest works when project is deployed on a running server but SpringXmlTest fails)
